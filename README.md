## The Premise

The week stretches before you like an endless dungeon. **Seven dinners** await. Two appetites. One kitchen.

Will you find **harmony**... or descend into takeout chaos?

## How It Works

1. **Start a Quest** — Enter your name, get a shareable link for your partner
2. **Pick & Bid** — Each player secretly chooses a meal from 5 options and bids enthusiasm tokens (0-3)
3. **Reveal** — Same pick? Harmony! Different picks? Weighted coin flip based on bids
4. **Repeat** — Battle through 7 days of dinner decisions
5. **Victory** — Get your weekly meal plan + stats

## Features

- 🎮 **Text-based RPG aesthetic** — Dramatic narrative, retro terminal vibes
- 🍕 **24 meal options** — From tacos to sushi, comfort food to healthy
- ⚔️ **Conflict resolution** — Bid tokens to influence outcomes
- 📊 **End-of-week stats** — Harmonies, conflicts, top cuisine, total cook time
- 📱 **Mobile-friendly** — Works on any device
- 🔗 **Async play** — Take turns whenever (currently requires same browser/device)

## Quick Start

Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build step, no dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dinner-quest.git

Or deploy to any static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

## Tech Stack
